# Components Narratives


## Setup

~~~html
<chat-component openAiAPIkey="<insert API key here>",id="<insert id here>"
                publish="showExplanation:show/explanation;getData:get/<targetComponentID>/data;getType:get/<targetComponentID>/type;get/<targetComponentID>/value"
                subscribe="workflowMap:dataPublish;receive/<targetComponentID>/data:receiveData;receive/<targetComponentID>/type:receiveType;receive/<targetComponentID>/value:receiveValue">
</chat-component>

## Narrative

* The chat component subscribes to the topic "workflowState", which has a map of all the connections made.
* Then, the component searches for the components which the chatGPT node is connected.
* Then, it will send getters to the component to retrive their data.
* After receiving all of them by the proper receive/<targetComponentID> bus,it will generate the prompt and will call the openAI Api with the customized prompt and its attribute openAiApiKey
* Finally, the response is published with the topic show/explanation
