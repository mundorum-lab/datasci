# Components Narratives


## Setup

~~~html
<chat-component attribute="openAiApiKey"
                publish="showExplanation:show/explanation"
                subscribe="workflowMap:dataPublish">
</chat-component>

~~~

## Narrative

* The chat component subscribes to the topic "`workflowMap", which has a map of all the connections made.
* Then, the component searches for the most relevant components that impact on the prompt generation.
* After that, it generates a prompt based on the relevant components attributes, such as name, columns, rows.
* It then calls the openAI Api with the customized prompt and its attribute openAiApiKey
* Finally, the response is published with the topic show/explanation
