# Components Narratives


## Setup

~~~html
<chat-button-oid componentId="<insert componentId here>" >
</chat-button-oid>

<chat-oid subscribe="exportWorkflow~graph" id="chat">
</chat-oid>

~~~

## Narrative

* The chat-oid component subscribes to the topic "workflowState", which has a map of all the connections made.
* The chat-button-oid is placed in each presentation module
* When a button is clicked, the chat button calls the chat-oid and provides the component id
* Then, the component searches int he workflow for the full path until the node the user would like to explain.
* Then, it will send getters to the component to retrive their data.
* After receiving all of them by the proper receive/<targetComponentID> bus,it will generate the prompt
* Then, the response returns to the chat button with the interface prompt
* Finally, the chat button copies the prompt to the clipboard, sending an alert and opens a new tab to chatGPT

## Example

* The index.html file can be used as an example
* The integration with a mock of the workflow can be seen in this file, also the value received can be seen in console.
* The integration with transform and graph components should be seen too, however it is not working properly yet.
